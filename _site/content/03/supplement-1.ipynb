    "These two expressions reveal that, at a large lag $L = N − 1$, the variance of the unbiased estimator is $N^2$ times the variance of the biased estimator. The dramatic increase in variance of the unbiased estimator leads to unreliable estimates of the autocovariance at large lags. Also, we note that the biased estimator behaves \"nicely\" as $L$ increases to $N$; we see from the expression for the biased estimator that $r_{xx}[N − 1]$ approaches 0 when $N$ is large. This is arguably the behavior we want; we have few data points to compare at large lags, and therefore an unreliable estimate of the autocovariance, so we’re better off disregarding these values. For these reasons, we’ll use the biased estimator; in this estimate, autocovariance values at large lags - which utilize less data and are typically noisier - are reduced.\n",

    "We note that, for the EEG data of interest here, the unbiased estimator outperforms the biased estimator. For these data, which are dominated by a 60 Hz rhythm, there is significant autocovariance even at long lags. In this case, the biased estimator leads to an interpretation of decreasing autocovariance, even though that is not true. However, for most brain signal (not saturated by 60 Hz line noise), we expect the autocovariance to decrease in time."
