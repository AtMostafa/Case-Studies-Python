    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Neurons in the retina typically respond to patterns of light displayed over small sections of the visual field. However, when retinal neurons are grown in culture and held under constant light and environmental conditions, they will still spontaneously fire action potentials. In a fully functioning retina, this spontaneous activity is sometimes described as background firing activity, which is modulated as a function of visual stimuli. It is useful to understand the properties of this background activity in order to determine in future experiments how these firing properties are affected by specific stimuli.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Case Study Data\n",
    "\n",
    "A researcher examining the background firing properties of one of these neurons contacts you to discuss his data. He records the spiking activity in one of two states, with the room lights off (low ambient light levels) or with the room lights on (high ambient light levels). He would like to collaborate with you to determine whether there is a difference in background firing between these two conditions, and whether one environment is more conducive to future experimental analyses. He records the spiking activity for 30 seconds in each condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically the first step in any data analysis involves visualizing and using simple descriptive statistics to characterize pertinent features of the data. For time series data that take on a continuous value at each time point, like the field potentials analyzed in earlier chapters, we typically start by simply plotting each data value as a function of time. For spike train data, things can become a bit more complicated. One reason for this is that there are multiple equivalent ways to describe the same spike train data. The data could be stored as a sequence of spike times; as a sequence of waiting times between spikes, or interspike intervals; or as a discrete time series indicating the number of spikes in discrete time bins. Knowing how to manipulate and visualize spike train data using all these different representations is the first step to understanding the structure present in the data and is the primary goal of this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "We develop tools in this chapter to visualize spike train data and to provide basic statistical methods appropriate for analyzing spike trains."
