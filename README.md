# Case-Studies-Python

** THIS IS VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS **

This repository is a companion to the textbook "Case Studies in Neural Data Analysis", by Mark Kramer and Uri Eden.  In the textbook, we use MATLAB to analyze examples of neuronal data.  The material here is essentially *identical*, except that we use Python (instead of MATLAB).

Our intended audience is the "practicing neuroscientist" - e.g., the students, researchers, and clinicians collecting neuronal data in the hospital or lab.  The material can get pretty mathy, but we've tried to outline the main concepts as directly as possible, with hands-on implementations of all concepts.  We focus on only two main types of data: spike trains and electric fields (such as the local field potential [LFP], or electroencephalogram [EEG]).  If you're interetsed in other data (e.g., calcium imagaing, or BOLD), you may still find the examples indirectly useful (for example, examples of how to compute and interpet a power spectrum of a signal).

We assume you have installed Python, and can get it running on your computer.  Some useful references to do so include,

<a href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</a>

We also make use of the <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a>, which provides a very slick way to work throught the Python examples directly in your web browser.

We'd like to thank all of students, collaborators, and funders who have helped make this possible!
