# Case-Studies-Python

This repository is a companion to the textbook "Case Studies in Neural Data Analysis", by Mark Kramer and Uri Eden.  In the textbook, we use MATLAB to analyze examples of neuronal data.  The material here is essentially *identical*, except that we use Python (instead of MATLAB).

We assume you have installed Python, and can get it running on your computer.  Some useful references to do so include,

<a href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</a>

We also make use of the <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a>, which provides a very slick way to work throught the Python examples directly in your web browser.
