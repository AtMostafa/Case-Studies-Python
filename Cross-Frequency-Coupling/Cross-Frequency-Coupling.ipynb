    "To assess whether different frequency rhythms interact in the LFP recording, we implement a measure to calculate CFC. The idea of CFC analysis is to determine whether a relation exists between the phase of a low-frequency signal and the envelope or amplitude of a high-frequency signal. In general, computing CFC involves three steps. Each step contains important questions and encompasses entire fields of study. Our goal in this section is to move quickly forward and produce a procedure we can employ, investigate, and criticize. Continued study of CFC—and the associated nuances of each step—is an active area of ongoing research.\n",

    "The first step in the CFC analysis is to filter the data into two frequency bands of interest. The choice is not arbitrary: the separate frequency bands are motivated by initial spectral analysis of the LFP data. In this case, we choose the low-frequency band as 5–7 Hz, consistent with the largest peak in the spectrum, and the high-frequency band as 80–120 Hz, consistent with the second-largest broadband peak. To consider alternative frequency bands, the same analysis steps would apply."
