    "## Introduction\n",
    "In <a href=\"03\" rel=\"local\">The Power Spectrum (part 1)</a>, we considered noninvasive recordings of brain electrical activity using scalp EEG. Although the scalp EEG provides fine temporal resolution of brain activity, the spatial resolution is poor because of the low conductivity of the skull [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195050387.001.0001\" rel=\"external\">Nunez & Srinivasan, 2005</a>]. An alternative, invasive approach to improve the spatial resolution of the scalp EEG is to record directly from the brain’s surface [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn1585\" rel=\"external\">Engel, Moll, Fried, & Ojemann, 2005</a>]. This technique, known as electrocorticogram (ECoG), eliminates the distorting spatial blurring effect of the skull at the cost of an invasive surgical procedure of implantation.\n",

    "### Case study data\n",
    "A patient with epilepsy is scheduled to undergo resective surgery to remove the portion of her brain causing recurrent, unprovoked seizures. As part of her clinical workup, electrodes are implanted beneath the skull, directly on the brain’s surface. We assume that our skilled neurosurgeon collaborator expertly implants the ECoG electrode, and that the ECoG data are collected with no artifacts. We receive from our clinical collaborator a 1 s segment of ECoG data recorded from a single electrode and sampled at 500 Hz. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "Our collaborator would like to know what rhythms appear in these invasive brain voltage recordings. Our goal is to analyze the 1 s of ECoG data by characterizing the rhythmic attributes of the activity. To do so, we build upon the spectral analysis techniques developed in <a href=\"03\" rel=\"local\">The Power Spectrum (part 1)</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools\n",
    "In this notebook, we continue to develop understanding of the Fourier transform and spectrum. We apply the techniques introduced in <a href=\"03\" rel=\"local\">The Power Spectrum (part 1)</a> to compute the spectrum. We also investigate the impact of windowing and zero padding on the spectrum, and explain how to apply and interpret the multitaper method."

However, ECoG recordings are finite, limited by convenience, technology, or other factors. In the example here, we consider 1 s of ECoG data. Performing this finite observation (lasting 1 s) on a long duration (i.e., 90-year) time series can be understood as a rectangular taper.

    "    \n",
    "**A.** The spectrum consists of features at many frequencies to represent the rapid increase and decrease of the rectangular taper (i.e., the rapid transition from 0 to 1, and then from 1 to 0). The intuition for this is that many sinusoids, aligned in a particular way, are required to represent a sharp transition in a time series. As an example, consider the following square wave function: \n",

    "<a id=\"fig:4-6\"></a>\n",
    "![Approximation of a square wave with sinusoids.](imgs/4-6.png \"Approximation of a square wave with sinusoids. Square wave (black) has a period of 2 Hz. As the number of sinusoids used to spproximate the square wave increases from (a) one sinusoid, to (b) two sinusoids, to (c) five sinusoids, approximation improves. Scale bar indicates 0.5 s.\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "This square wave (black) consists of many repeated sharp transitions. Visual inspection suggests that the square wave is rhythmic, with a period of 2 Hz. Notice that the square wave begins at a sustained value of 1, then transitions to 0 and remains there for an interval of time, and then transitions back to a value of 1 in 0.5 s; the square wave therefore completes two cycles in 1 second.\n",
    " \n",
    "So, the square wave is rhythmic, and we may try to represent this square wave with rhythmic sinusoids. In *(a)*, we plot a 2 Hz sinusoid. It’s an okay match to the square wave but certainly not perfect; the 2 Hz sinusoid fails to capture the sharp transitions of the square wave. In *(b)*, we plot the sum of a 2 Hz sinusoid and a 6 Hz sinusoid. The combination of these two sinusoids better matches the square wave, although again the sharp transitions are not accurately captured. In *(c)*, we plot the sum of 2 Hz, 6 Hz, 10 Hz, 14 Hz, and 18 Hz sinusoids. These five sinusoids better match the square wave and begin to more accurately capture the sharp transitions. As more sinusoids are used to represent the square wave, the approximation of the sharp edges improves.\n",

    "Because we perform multiplication of two functions in the time domain (i.e., we multiply the rectangular taper and the infinite sinusoid element by element), we produce a convolution of the Fourier transforms of these functions in the frequency domain. Although the mathematical expression of convolution is somewhat complicated, we can understand the impact of convolution by examining a few plots. Let’s start with the Fourier transform of the infinite sinusoid and the infinite rectangular taper (where we’ve appended zeros to the rectangular taper to make it infinite). We know (or can look up) the results of each Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of the infinite 10 Hz sinusoid, which we assume here is a cosine function, consists of two delta functions at ±10 Hz. \n",

However, once we shift the rectangular taper’s Fourier transform up to and through the 10 Hz peak of the sinusoid, we begin to find larger deviations in the convolution. As the shifted rectangular taper’s Fourier transform passes through the 10 Hz peak of the sinusoid, we multiply the very thin and very tall peak of the sinusoid (bottom plot) with the center portion of the shifted rectangular taper’s Fourier transform. The result of this multiplication is to “smear” the sharp peak of the sinusoid in the frequency domain. Instead of a sharp peak at 10 Hz, the convolution produces a broad, wiggly peak in the frequency domain, with deviations at neighboring frequencies (i.e., in the side lobes around 10 Hz). In other words, because we observe the sinusoid over a finite interval of time (determined by the extent of the rectangular taper) the Fourier transform of the sinusoid becomes “smeared.”\n",

    "#### Zero padding.\n",
    "An interesting issue to consider is how appending zeros impacts the spectrum of the rectangular taper. We know that increasing the signal length $(T)$ improves the frequency resolution; recall the equation $df = 1/T$ from <a href=\"03\" rel=\"local\">The Power Spectrum (part 1)</a>. We therefore expect that adding more points to the signal (even noninformative points, such as zeros) will increase the number of points along the frequency axis. However, appending zeros to a time series is not equivalent to observing more data (and thereby increasing $T\\,$). By appending zeros, we of course do not gain any additional information about the signal. Therefore appending zeros to a signal cannot improve the frequency resolution. Instead, the impact of appending zeros is to increase the number of points along the frequency axis in the spectrum. This can be useful in visualizing the spectrum; for example, by appending more and more zeros to the rectangular taper, we produce a less jagged spectrum."

    "## Beyond the Hanning Taper&mdash;The Multitaper Method\n",
    "The Hanning taper provides a nice alternative to the rectangular taper. If we’re willing to allow slightly broader spectral peaks in the frequency domain, and lose some data near the taper edges in the time domain, then the Hanning taper helps reduce the impact of side lobes. We now consider a brief introduction to a more advanced approach to tapering, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitaper\" rel=\"external\">multitaper method</a>. The idea of the multitaper method is to apply multiple tapers to the data, each with a different shape. The spectrum is then computed for each taper, and the results averaged over the tapers. Each taper, which is given by portions of the discrete prolate spheroidal sequences, provides an independent estimate of the (theoretical) spectrum. Therefore, the variance of the average estimate over the tapers is $1/K$ times the variance of the estimated spectrum from a single taper, where $K$ is the number of tapers used. The multitaper method has a number of additional advantages, such as minimizing the bias due to other spectral peaks outside of the frequency band being considered. We do not discuss these properties in detail, but more information can be found in [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511622762\" rel=\"external\">Percival & Walden, 1998</a>, <a href=\"https://buprimo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=ALMA_BOSU121668583370001161&context=L&vid=BU&search_scope=default_scope&tab=default_tab&lang=en_US\" rel=\"external\">Priestley, 1981</a>].\n",
    "In the preceding examples, we estimated the spectrum from an observed time series. Often from these estimates we have difficulty identifying features that are significant (or not). For example, consider the small peak at 40–50 Hz in the plot of the ECoG spectrum.<a href=\"#fig:4-11d\" class=\"sup\">fig<img src=\"imgs/4-11d.png\"></a> Is that peak significant or a random fluctuation we expect in an estimate from real-world ECoG data? To address this question, we might consider collecting more data and using these additional data to improve our estimate of power. However, collecting more data does not automatically improve the spectral estimate. Instead, collecting more data (i.e., increasing the duration of data recorded, $T$) produces more spectral estimates at additional frequencies, yet the spectrum at each frequency remains just as variable. We would like a way to improve the spectral estimate—a way to reduce the variability of the estimate—so that we could more confidently identify interesting features. The multitaper method offers a procedure to do so. However, this comes at a cost. If we desire reduced variance in the spectral estimate, we must accept worse frequency resolution. Let’s explore these issues in more detail.\n",

As we add more tapers, each contains more “wiggles.” In particular, as the number of tapers increases, the edges of the data become better represented. Unlike the Hanning taper, which slowly approaches zero at the taper edges, some of these tapers increase near the window edges (see taper 5). This can be useful, especially if we are interested in the spectral features near the beginning and end of the data. Just as with the Hanning taper, we multiply the time series data by each taper, which emphasizes different intervals of the data. We show examples of this multiplication for the ECoG data in the plot on the right.

Both peaks are still visible, at least partially, in the multitaper spectra estimates. We notice that as the time-bandwidth product increases, the frequency resolution becomes worse, and it becomes more difficult to resolve these two peaks; these neighboring peaks start to smear together. This is expected and the trade-off we accept in the multitaper method. The big payoff of the multitaper method occurs in the higher-frequency bands. As the time-bandwidth product increases, we observe a small elevation across a broad frequency range, at approximately 30–50 Hz. The spectral density in this interval is small and was hidden by the noise in the previous spectral estimates using the rectangular taper or the Hanning taper. However, by using many tapers in the multitaper method, we reduce this noise and reveal the broad elevation of power.

    "In this notebook, we analyzed the rhythmic activity present in 1 s of ECoG data. We computed the spectrum and considered two issues: zero padding and tapering. We discussed that zero padding can increase the number of points along the frequency axis but cannot change the frequency resolution. We also explored the trade-off between three different tapers: the rectangular taper, the Hanning taper, and the multitaper method. The Hanning taper reduces the side lobes present in the rectangular taper, but fattens the spectral peaks. The multitaper method reduces the variance of the spectrum at the cost of worsened frequency resolution. Applying all three measures to the ECoG data allowed us to explore the rhythmic activity of these data in different ways. All three methods suggest rhythmic content at low frequencies, near 6–7 Hz, consistent with the visual inspection of the time series. Applying the Hanning taper, we uncovered activity in the 10–15 Hz range. Applying the multitaper method, we uncovered broadband activity at 30–50 Hz. This activity, hidden in the noisy spectrum, only became apparent upon increasing the number of tapers. However, this increase necessarily reduces the frequency resolution and can hide the low-frequency rhythms. In this case, we find it useful to examine the spectrum in a variety of ways.\n",

    "In the first two lines, we define two simple signals; each consists of only four elements, which is enough to illustrate the relation. In the third line, we first compute the convolution of $w$ and $x$, and then the Fourier transform. In the fourth and fifth lines, we compute the Fourier transform of each variable, and then their element-by-element product. Notice that we zero-pad both variables before computing their Fourier transforms. We do so to avoid computing circular correlations between the variables (i.e., wrapping around one variable when comparing it to another). Also, we make the lengths of variables $a$ and $b$ the same. Evaluating the statement, we find the difference between $a$ and $b$ to be on the order of $10^{-15}$, which is very close to zero.\n",
