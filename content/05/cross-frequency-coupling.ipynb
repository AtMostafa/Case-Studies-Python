    "\n",
    "In this module, we focus on local field potential (LFP) recordings. The LFP is a measure of local population neural activity, [produced from small aggregates of neurons](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22595786). In these data, we examine the association between rhythms of different frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, lower-frequency rhythms have been observed to engage larger brain areas and modulate spatially localized fast oscillations (see, [for example](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18388295)). Of the different types of cross-frequency coupling [(CFC) observced between brain rhythms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26549886), perhaps the most is **phase-amplitude coupling** (PAC), in which the phase of a low frequency rhythm modulates the amplitude (or power) of a high frequency rhythm. Cross-frequency coupling been observed in many brain regions, has been shown to change in time with task demands, and has been proposed to serve a [functional role](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3359652/) in working memory, neuronal computation, communication, and learning. Although the cellular and dynamic mechanisms of specific rhythms associated with CFC are relatively well understood, the mechanisms governing interactions between different frequency rhythms - and the appropriate techniques for measuring CFC - remain active research areas. Although we consider only a single electrode recording here, we note that these techniques can be extended to association measures between electrodes as well.\n",

She has implanted a small bundle of electrodes, which remain (chronically) implanted as the rat explores a large circular arena. She is interested in assessing the association between different frequency rhythms of the LFP, and more specifically whether an association between different frequency rhythms exists as the rat explores the arena. To address this question, she has provided us with 100 s of LFP data recorded during the experiment (i.e., while the rat spontaneously explored the arena)."

    "Now, let's make use of an important fact. Multiplication of two quantities in the frequency domain corresponds to convolution of these two quantities in the time domain (see [Analysis of Rhythmic Activity in an Electrocorticogram](../Analysis%20of%20Rhythmic%20Activity%20in%20an%20Electrocorticogram/Analysis%20of%20rhythmic%20activity%20in%20the%20Electrocorticogram.ipynb)). The convolution of two signals $x$ and $y$ is \n",

    "This time domain representation of the HIlbert Transform is equivalent to the frequency domain representation. However, the time domain representation is much less intuitive. Compare the previous equation to the statement, \"*The Hilbert Transform is a 90-degree phase shift in the frequency domain.*\" The latter, we propose, is much more intuitive."
