    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Neurons in the retina typically respond to patterns of light displayed over small sections of the visual field. However, when retinal neurons are grown in culture and held under constant light and environmental conditions, they will still spontaneously fire action potentials. In a fully functioning retina, this spontaneous activity is sometimes described as background firing activity, which is modulated as a function of visual stimuli. It is useful to understand the properties of this background activity in order to determine in future experiments how these firing properties are affected by specific stimuli.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Case Study Data\n",
    "\n",
    "A researcher examining the background firing properties of one of these neurons contacts you to discuss his data. He records the spiking activity in one of two states, with the room lights off (low ambient light levels) or with the room lights on (high ambient light levels). He would like to collaborate with you to determine whether there is a difference in background firing between these two conditions, and whether one environment is more conducive to future experimental analyses. He records the spiking activity for 30 seconds in each condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically the first step in any data analysis involves visualizing and using simple descriptive statistics to characterize pertinent features of the data. For time series data that take on a continuous value at each time point, like the field potentials analyzed in earlier chapters, we typically start by simply plotting each data value as a function of time. For spike train data, things can become a bit more complicated. One reason for this is that there are multiple equivalent ways to describe the same spike train data. The data could be stored as a sequence of spike times; as a sequence of waiting times between spikes, or interspike intervals; or as a discrete time series indicating the number of spikes in discrete time bins. Knowing how to manipulate and visualize spike train data using all these different representations is the first step to understanding the structure present in the data and is the primary goal of this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "We develop tools in this chapter to visualize spike train data and to provide basic statistical methods appropriate for analyzing spike trains."

To answer these types of questions, we need to develop statistical methods that are appropriate for analyzing spike trains.

    "**A.** These data are stored as a sequence of time stamps representing an increasing sequence of times at which the neuron spiked. When we run the plot command with only one input vector, we plot an index that runs from 1 to the length of the vector on the $x$-axis against the numerical values in that vector on the $y$-axis. Therefore the plot shows an increasing line where the $x$-axis represents the spike number and the $y$-axis represents the spike time. Notice that the vector ends at an $x$-axis value of 750, which corresponds to the length of the vector. Also, the values on the $y$-axis range from 0 to 30; these correspond to times starting near 0 s and ending near 30 s, as we expect for the 30 s recording. Although this plot is not immediately useful, the results are consistent with our expectations for the data.\n",

    "With the data visualized in this way, we’re now able to ask an interesting question: What structure do you notice in the two spike trains? At first glance, your answer might be “not much.” Spikes occur fairly regularly throughout the 5 s interval under both conditions. Perhaps a careful visual inspection suggests there are fewer spikes in the low-light than in the high-light condition. But the spike times themselves do not seem to be directly comparable between these conditions. Often, when we examine data from a stimulus response experiment, we expect to see regions where spiking activity increases or decreases as a function of a changing stimulus. In this case, the stimulus is the ambient light level, which remains constant over the entire experiment. How else can we analyze these data and identify differences in the spiking activity (if any) between the two conditions?"

    "**A.** Let’s focus on the first command, which defines the variable `ISIsLow`. Here, we use the function `diff()` with input `SpikesLow`. If you have not seen the command `diff()` before, look it up using `np.diff()?`. Briefly, the `diff()` command computes the difference between adjacent elements of the input. In this case, the vector `SpikesLow` represents the times at which spikes occur. Therefore, the difference between adjacent elements of `SpikesLow` produces the time interval or waiting time between successive spikes.

The difference between the next two adjacent elements of $v$ is\n",

    "Plots of the ISI vectors provide some information about the data (e.g., the approximate range of the ISI values), but there’s more insight to be gained. To that end, let’s now implement another approach to visualizing these types of data: the [histogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram). The idea of a histogram is to count the number of occurrences of each value in the data. In this case, we count the number of times we observe an ISI value in different bins of time. Let’s define the time bins for the histogram. Inspection of the ISI data for the low-light condition reveals values that range from near 0 s to over 0.4 s. Therefore, we choose the following time bins:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bin 0 [0.00 0.01] \n",
    "\n",

    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "Bin N [0.49 0.50]\n",
    "\n",
    "The bins begin at time 0 s and end at time 0.5 s, with a bin size of 0.01 s. The purpose of the histogram is to count the number of times the data values fall into each bin. Notice that we’ve chosen the range of bins to extend beyond the observed range of data `ISIsLow`; that’s fine, and we expect to count no values in the bins near 0.5 s. To further explore this counting process, let’s examine the first eight values of the data `ISIsLow`:"

    "\n",
    "Another common approach to analyzing spiking data is to discretize time into bins of fixed width and count the number of events that occur in each time bin. The sequence of spike counts across all the bins is sometimes called the increment process for the spike train. When the time bins are sufficiently small, say, 1 ms for typical spike train data, the resulting increment process is just a sequence of zeros and ones. In this case, the time bins are so small that the probability of more than one spike occurring in each bin is zero or negligibly small.<sup><abbr title=\"The biophysical mechanisms that produce a spike support this statement. After generating a spike, the neuron experiences a refractory period typically lasting a few milliseconds, in which generating a subsequent spike is very unlikely.\">note</abbr></sup> Each tiny time bin then contains a spike (and we assign that bin a value of 1) or does not (and we assign that bin a value of 0). This idea of representing the spike train as a sequence of zeros and ones for small bin increments will be important when we build statistical models of the spike trains in a [later notebook](../09/point-process-glms.html). In this section, we compute the increment process with multiple bin sizes in order to characterize the amount of variability in the spiking data and to examine temporal dependencies between spikes.\n",

On the other hand, consider the scenario of a neuron that fires in irregular bursts. In this case, we expect much more variability in the number of spikes in each time bin, depending on whether a time bin contained a burst of spikes or a quiet period. To characterize this variability, a standard measure to compute is the sample **Fano factor (FF)**.

The next two inputs specify the shape and scale parameters of the gamma distribution. Evaluating this line of code, we find the interval (0.890, 1.116). Therefore, if we observed a true Poisson process with N = 600 bins and computed the Fano factor, we would not be surprised to find values between 0.890 and 1.116. However, the observed Fano factor for an increment process with 50 ms bins in the low-light condition is well outside of this range; this result suggests that it is very unlikely that these data were generated by a Poisson process. Instead, it’s more likely that these data were generated by a process with less variability in the low-light condition (FF = 0.72)."

    "The autocorrelation of the increments indicates the amount of time for which there are dependencies in the spiking data. In the high-light condition, we found large correlation values extending out to approximately 50 ms. This could be a consequence of the influence of patterns of many spikes with shorter ISIs or of single spikes with longer ISIs. We can distinguish between these possibilities by looking at the autocorrelation of the sequence of ISIs. In this case, the lag represents the number of spikes in the past rather than the amount of time in the past. If the dependence is only due to the last spike, we expect the ISIs to be uncorrelated at any nonzero lag. This would necessarily be true for data from a Poisson process. If we see correlation between ISIs, this suggests that the data do not come from a Poisson process and that the past spiking has an influence over multiple spikes. To investigate this, let’s compute the autocorrelation of the sequence of ISIs for the low-light condition:\n",

The former suggested dependence going back up to $\\approx$ 50 ms (<a href=\"#fig:8-12\" class=\"fig\">figure<span><img src=\"imgs/8-12.png\"></span></a>), while the latter suggested that the spiking at any time depends only on the timing of the most recent spike (<a href=\"#fig:8-14\" class=\"fig\">figure<span><img src=\"imgs/8-14.png\"></span></a>). We now consider another powerful technique to understand these data: building a model. More specifically, we construct a *statistical model* of these data. This model captures important features of the data but does not consist of explicit biophysical components (an example of a biologically explicit model is the Hodgkin-Huxley equations [[Hodgkin & Huxley, 1952](https://doi.org/10.1113/jphysiol.1952.sp004764)]. The notion of a model can be confusing and is audience dependent, so we clarify here.\n",

In other words, we begin with a model where the number of spikes in any time bin is independent of all previous (and future) spiking and has a Poisson distribution with a fixed but unknown rate parameter $\\lambda$.

One nice result for comparing CDFs is that with enough data, the maximum difference between the model and empirical CDFs has a known asymptotic distribution, which can be used to put confidence bounds about the KS plot [[Kass, Eden & Brown, 2014](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-9602-1)].

    "## Summary\n",
    "In this chapter, we considered the spiking activity recorded in two conditions. We began with visualizations of the spiking data, and construction and visualization of the increment process (i.e., binned spike counts). We then assessed the variability in the increments through computation of the Fano factor, and showed that the low- and high-light conditions had less and more variability, respectively, than expected for a Poisson process. We also assessed the autocorrelation of the increment processes and observed the impact of refractoriness and bursting activity. In addition, we created and visualized the ISIs for each condition. Inspection of the ISI histograms suggested bursting activity in both conditions, and more small ISIs in the high-light condition. Analysis of the ISI autocorrelations revealed no compelling evidence for dependence and supported the hypothesis of a renewal process. Finally, we built two statistical models of the observed ISIs. We discussed how to fit the model parameters by computing the maximum likelihood estimate, and how to evaluate the model goodness-of-fit to the data using the KS plot. We showed that the first model—the Poisson process as a model of spiking with a corresponding exponential distribution of ISIs—did not fit the observed ISI data. A second model—the inverse Gaussian probability model—provided a much more accurate fit to the observed ISIs. The modeling suggests that at least two features of the spiking activity have changed from the low-light to the high-light condition. First, the mean ISI is smaller, and hence the average firing rate is larger, in the high-light condition. Second, the shape of the firing distribution has changed so that the cell is more likely to fire in bursts with short ISIs in the high-light condition."
