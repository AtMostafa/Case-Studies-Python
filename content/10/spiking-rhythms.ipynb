    "## Introduction<a id=\"introduction\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a component of the basal ganglia that is thought to play an important role in the regulation of motor function. Neurons in the STN often have rhythmic spiking dynamics, and aberrations in the spike rhythms in STN have been associated with tremor and other motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease. In fact, the STN is one of the primary targets for deep brain stimulation (DBS) to treat Parkinsonian disorders. While the mechanisms by which DBS works are largely unknown, many researchers have hypothesized that altering rhythmic activity in the STN is an important component. Therefore, it is important to be able to characterize spike rhythms in STN neurons and to know with statistical confidence when these rhythms have changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous modules, we developed and used methods to uncover rhythmic dynamics in field recordings. Many of the methods used to characterize rhythms in *spiking data* may be familiar, like autocorrelation functions and spectral estimators, but will require additional care to interpret. In some cases, rhythmic spiking dynamics can be much more subtle than the rhythms identified fields, and statistical modeling methods will be needed to make powerful inferences from spiking data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Case Study Data\n",
    "\n",
    "A clinical neurosurgeon contacts you to help her analyze spiking data she collects from patients with Parkinson’s disease during surgery to implant DBS electrodes. She is interested in making sure that the electrode is localized properly in the STN, and in studying the role that STN activity plays in movement planning and execution for these patients. She asks each patient to perform a simple hand movement task during the electrode implantation procedure, and records the resulting neural activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data consist of single unit spiking activity from one STN neuron recorded over 50 trials of a hand movement task. In each trial, a patient held a joystick and watched cues appear on a screen. The first cue indicated whether the patient should move the joystick to the left or right. The second cue, the GO cue, indicated the time to start moving the joystick. The dataset contains 2 s of activity for each trial, 1 s before the GO cue and 1 s after. We label the period before the GO cue comes on the planning period, and the period after the GO cue the movement period.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "It is well known that the spiking activity of some STN neurons in patients with Parkinson’s disease shows rhythmic properties in the beta frequency range, 11–30 Hz (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/archneurpsyc.1938.02270010106010\" target=\"blank\">[Jasper & Andrews, 1938]</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.05.084\" target=\"blank\">[Brittain & Brown, 2014]</a>). The neurosurgeon hypothesizes that information related to the movement task, such as the planning versus the movement period and whether the movement is to the left or right, will influence this rhythmic spiking activity. Our goal is to characterize the spiking properties, identify whether rhythmic activity is present and statistically significant, and how such activity is influenced by the task variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools<a id=\"tools\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "We extend some of the tools already developed for studying rhythms and modeling spike trains. Many of the [basic visualization tools](../08/), such as raster plots, ISI histograms, and autocorrelation functions are useful without modification. We compute spectral estimators for spiking data using the same methods as before, but we have to think carefully about how to interpret the spectrum of a point process. Finally, we extend the [GLM methods we previously developed for spike train data](../09/) to allow us to model history-dependent, non-Poisson spiking processes."

Instead, if we think about spiking activity as arising from a random point process, we can consider rhythmic spiking as the influence of past spiking on the probability of observing a spike at some time in the future. In other words, another way to think about rhythmic spiking is as a history-dependent point process. Later, we build specific probability models to capture this history dependence.

    "So far, we have focused on statistical characterizations of spike trains in the time domain. Another approach to visualizing and describing structure in point processes focuses on estimating rhythmic (or harmonic) features of the data in the frequency domain. In [modules 3](../03) and [4](../04), we discussed methods to decompose field data (or continuous valued functions and random processes) into harmonic components. The same type of approach can be used to decompose point processes and to determine the relative contributions to their variability attributable to each frequency. Point process spectral estimation provides a useful tool for spike train analysis but should be performed with care. On the one hand, computing spectral estimates for discrete spike train data is similar to the approaches used for continuous valued signals. On the other hand, the interpretation of point process spectra can differ from continuous process spectra, and blindly applying intuition from continuous spectral estimation to point process data can lead to incorrect interpretations.\n",

    "So far we have focused on descriptive statistics and visualization methods to characterize the properties of the spike train data. In [module 9](../09), we developed point process models to understand the factors influencing a spiking process. We can use the same types of models to describe how past spiking activity influences future activity to produce rhythmic spiking and other forms of history dependence. In doing so, we utilize all the tools that we previously developed for point process modeling: tools to fit parameters and construct confidence bounds, tools to measure the goodness-of-fit between the model and the data, and tools for testing whether individual model components or combinations of components provide significant improvements in fitting the data.\n",

    "In this case study, we continue to use a specific class of models, **generalized linear models** (GLMs) for point processes. As discussed in [module 9](../09), GLMs have a number of attractive properties, including the fact that we can guarantee that the likelihood of the data as a function of the model parameters is convex and therefore has one peak that is easy to find. As in [module 9](../09), we will use the `Statsmodels` <a href=\"https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html\" target=\"blank\">package</a> to fit our GLM parameters. Let's revisit how to do this. \n",

    "The first input to `sm.GLM` is the response vector—the spike train—which is an $n \\times 1$ vector. We have to reshape the spike train to be one long vector containing all the trials sequentially, and also construct the design matrix accordingly. The second input to this function is the design matrix or predictors. This is an $n \\times p$ matrix, where $n$ is the total number of time steps in the dataset, and $p$ is the number of predictors in the model. For these data, we have 50 trials, each comprising 2,000 time steps, so $n = 50 \\times 2000 = 100,000$ data points. The third input is the GLM distribution to use. Here we assume that the spike count in each bin is approximately Poisson, as we did in [module 9](../09). Recall that by selecting the Poisson GLM, we implicitly use a log link function. In other words, we set the log of the firing rate to be a linear function of the predictors and model parameters. Equivalently, we construct a model of the form $\\lambda(t) = e^{\\beta X(t)}$, where $\\lambda(t)$ is the spiking intensity at time $t$, $X(t)$ is a $p \\times 1$ column vector of the predictors at time $t$, and $\\beta$ is a $1 \\times p$ column vector of the model parameters. Since each bin contains either 0 or 1 spike, we could also use the binomial distribution with a maximum of one count in each bin. However, choosing the Poisson count distribution will make it easier to interpret the resulting models.\n",

It stores data in a table under named columns and has some handy built-in functions that make it easy to use. Moreover, dataframes are often used in Pythonic data analyses, so you will likely see them again. A *formula* is a character string that describes the model. It will look something like `responses ~ predictors` (read \"responses as a function of predictors\").

For those models, the number of spikes in each of the small discrete-time bins is assumed to have a Poisson distribution, and the number of spikes in any two nonoverlapping bins is assumed to be independent. A simple result from probability theory is that the sum of independent Poisson random variables also has a Poisson distribution. Therefore, for those previous models, the number of spikes over multiple time bins, which is the sum of the number of spikes in each bin, still has a Poisson distribution, and all those previous models would be considered Poisson process models.\n",

Even if the number of spikes in a small time bin is assumed to be Poisson, it is no longer the case that the number of spikes in any larger interval will be Poisson. Thus, we would no longer call the resulting spike train a Poisson process. We still use the notation $\\lambda(t)$ to represent the expected number of spikes in the $t^{th}$ time bin, but this is no longer called a Poisson rate function.

    "Each of these values represents a modulation to the firing intensity when a previous spike has occurred at the given lag. For both periods, the value at lag 1 ms is near zero, suggesting that the probability of spiking again immediately after a previous spike is greatly reduced—the neuron is refractory. At lags greater than 1 ms, the probability of spiking now is increased when there is a spike at the given lag. For example, if there is a spike 6 ms in the past during the movement period, the probability of spiking is modulated by about 1.8, or it increases by about 80%. A modulation value near 1 suggests no effect on the spike intensity related to a spike at that lag. For the movement period, we see a refractory period followed by a period of increased intensity 6 ms after a spike. However, any spiking 10 ms in the past or longer appears to have no effect on the current spiking intensity. During the planning period, we see a similar pattern of refractoriness followed by increased intensity up to lag 10 ms. At longer lags, however, we see a pattern of decreased spiking probability about 15–35 ms after a spike, followed by increased spiking probability about 45–65 ms after a spike. The parameter values for these periods suggest that the modulation for these lags is relatively small, about a 10%–15% decrease or increase in the firing intensity."

For the movement period, most of the parameters for lags above 8 ms do not suggest significant modulation. For the planning period, we find a few parameters for higher lags that are significant on their own. However, in this case we have to be careful about multiple comparisons. As discussed in [module 8](../08), if we control the probability of a single test or comparison being significant by chance at 0.05, then after performing multiple tests or comparisons, the probability that any of them are deemed significant by chance becomes much higher. For 140 independent comparisons, even if no effects are actually present, the probability of finding at least one to be significant by chance is $1 - 0.95^{140} = 0.99$.\n",

Instead of 140 separate tests for each lag in each period, we can construct a single test to answer a question of direct interest: Is there a significant difference between the complete sets of history parameters in the planning and movement periods? In [module 9](../09), we discussed maximum likelihood ratio tests (MLRTs) for point process models. We showed that for nested models (where one model can be made equivalent to the other by setting some parameters to specific values), under the null hypothesis that the data arise from the smaller model, the difference in the deviance between the two models should have a chi-square distribution with the number of degrees of freedom equal to the number of extra parameters in the larger model.

We chose somewhat arbitrarily a model order of 70 for the number of history-dependent terms for both the planning and movement periods, based on the visualization analyses. In subsequent modeling, we found that many of these parameters did not contribute significantly to the model fit on their own. One approach to selecting model order is to start by fitting a higher-order model than you suspect is necessary, and then paring down the parameters that are not significant on their own. In this example, this process would leave a few parameters at small lags for both the planning and movement periods, and one parameter corresponding to a lag of 50 ms for the planning period. However, the MLRT example showed that although many of the history-dependent parameters in this model are not significant on their own, together they substantially improve the model.\n",

One key point is that we can think about spike rhythms in terms of how the likelihood of spiking depends on its own history. Many of the most useful visualization tools that we explored, such as the autocorrelation plot and the spectral estimates, implicitly define the covariability of the spiking process with its past. The GLM methods allowed us to model this history dependence explicitly and to explore multiple features of the data simultaneously.\n",

    "In the STN data, we also saw that rhythmic spiking structure can be subtle and hard to detect if we do not use the proper tools. The dynamic rhythms in these data were nearly impossible to see in raster plots or ISI histograms but became quite apparent in the autocorrelation plot, spectral density estimates, and model fits. Many people think of rhythmic spiking data as being like the beats of a metronome: perfect beats at a specific frequency. But we saw that very subtle changes in the firing probability, perhaps just a 10% increase or decrease at a particular lag, can lead to robust rhythms, as identified by visualization and modeling tools. Real spike rhythms often look more like the examples in this chapter than like the rhythms of a beating metronome."
